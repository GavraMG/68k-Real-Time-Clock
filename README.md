## About My Program

The Assembly Clock Program is a digital clock implemented in 68000 Assembly language, designed as a hands-on project for my microprocessor class. This project helped me delve deeper into low-level programming and gain practical experience working with the 68000 microprocessor. The clock displays time in a simple and accurate format, showcasing concepts like looping, timing control, and memory management in Assembly. It provides a basic but functional interface, representing the power of fundamental operations to create a recognizable and useful utility.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Clock:** Displays the current time using the 68000 Assembly microprocessor's timing operations.
- **Simple Interface:** Minimalistic display, focusing on functionality over complexity.
- **Accurate Timing:** Leverages precise loops and registers for consistent timekeeping.
- **Uses Interrupts:** Uses ISR 6 to run the program and ISR 7 to reset the clock, demonstrating interrupt-driven programming.
- **Educational Value:** A great example for learning how Assembly handles logical operations, loops, and memory.

üíª Tech Used

This program uses:

- **68000 Assembly Language:** The core language used to build the clock logic, showcasing fundamental aspects of low-level programming.
- **Easy68K Simulator:** Used to run and debug the Assembly program.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Assemble the program using the Easy68K simulator.
2. Set the hardware interrupt to number 6.
3. Set the millisecond delay to `00000016`.
4. Checkmark the "Automatic" box for interrupt 6.
5. To reset the clock, click the interrupt 7 button.
